This is my first post on react project, I am really excited to share my thoughts with you guys on how I struggled to create my first react project. I was motivated by Tanay to explore more on React JS and after going through his course, one thing I noticed is his explanation behind mentioning the mistake and rectifying the same, the actually made me think of explaining my small journey of going through the course of Shaun Wassell on Building Modern Project with React (I will mention the reason behind choosing his course in the next paragraph) and doting down the mistakes that I have encountered while trying the project on my own and how I rectified the same. It is way easier to just copy and paste the project from the course exercise file but when it comes to writing the code we realize how some silly mistakes can create a big issue on the project.

The course introduced by Shaun Wassell is really amazing and his explanatory skills are top-notch, what I really found exciting about his course was the detail behind why a particular package is chosen, how we can build the project without using <strong>npx create-react-app my-app</strong>. He started with initiating package.json and kept on adding the required package and explaining the reason behind the same which cleared more thoughts and gave ideas to explore more on the same. This thought actually motivated me to go on with the project.

My first encounter of warning in React: Even though a warning is something we can ignore, however, a frontend developer should be keen enough to check the reason on the same at an early stage because you never know a small warning can be a big disaster later.
